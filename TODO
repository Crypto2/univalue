Rearrange tree for easier 'git subtree' style use

Move towards C++11 etc.

Namespace support - must come up with useful shorthand, avoiding
long Univalue::Univalue::Univalue usages forced upon library users.

Improve test suite

Add iterator support, and make erase() method more like vector::erase()
with begin(), end() and all that entails.

test/object:univalue_modify()   test for erase() true/false return
